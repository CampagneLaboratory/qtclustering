The qtclustering library contains Java based classes to aid in the
classification of objects into different groups, or more precisely, the
partitioning of a data set into subsets (clusters), so that the data in
each subset (ideally) share some common trait - often proximity according
to some defined distance measure.

The clustering library requires Java 5 or better and the fastutil
(http://fastutil.dsi.unimi.it/) library.  The binary distribution of
the clustering library contains two jar files described as follows:

  - clustering.jar        includes all the external classes needed to run
                          (i.e., fastutil)
  - clustering-core.jar   includes only the project classes and will require a
                          fastutil.jar to use in your own projects.
