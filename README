The qtclustering library contains Java based classes to aid in the
classification of objects into different groups, or more precisely, the
partitioning of a data set into subsets (clusters), so that the data in
each subset (ideally) share some common trait - often proximity according
to some defined distance measure.

The clustering library requires Java 5 or better and the following libraries:

  - Apache Commons Lang                    http://commons.apache.org/lang/
  - Apache log4j                           http://logging.apache.org/log4j/
  - fastutil                               http://fastutil.dsi.unimi.it/
  - MG4J (Managing Gigabytes for Java)     http://mg4j.dsi.unimi.it/
  - Parallel Java Library (PJ)             http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ark/pj.shtml

The binary distribution of the clustering library contains two jar files
described as follows:

  - qtclustering.jar      includes all the external classes needed to run
                          (i.e., fastutil, log4j, etc.)
  - qtclustering-core.jar includes only the project classes and will require a
                          the libraies listed above to use in your own projects
